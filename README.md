# The Boron Standard Library

Provides the Boron compiler with a list of simple functions.

All functions must be manually imported by the user by `use std.module.function`.

# Building the Standard Library

The standard library can be downloaded, installed, and built using an up-to-date installation of the `boron` compiler.  Instructions for installing `boron` are available [here](https://github.com/hobbsbros/boron.git).

The following list of commands will download, install, and build the Boron standard library into the working directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hobbsbros/boron-std.git
$ mv boron-std $HOME/.boron-std
$ boron $HOME/.boron-std --build
```

# WIP Disclaimer

This is still a work-in-progress.  Software is continuously forthcoming.
